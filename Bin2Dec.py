'''
allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's and 1's, in any sequence and then
displays its decimal equivalent.

Conditions:
- Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user;
- Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the sequence must be calculated using
a single mathematical function, for example the natural logarithm. It's up to you to figure out which
function to use.
